PiCamera Basic and Advanced Recipes adapted from "official" documentation for training purposes. The purpose of this document to record my experience in following the documentation prepared by Dave Jones.

## Basic Recipes

1. Capturing to a file - ./basic/CaptureToFile.py

2. Capturing to a stream - ./basic/CaptureToStream.py

3. Capturing to a PIL Image - ./basic/CaptureToPIL.py

4. Capturing resized images - ./basic/CatpureResizedImage.py

5. Capturing consistent images

6. Capturing time-lapse sequences

7. Capturing in low light

8. Capturing to a network stream

9. Recording video to a file

10. Recording video to a stream

11. Recording over multiple files

12. Recording to a circular stream

13. Recording to a network stream

14. Overlaying images on the preview

15. Overlaying text on the output

16. Controlling the LED

## Advanced Recipes

1. Capturing to a numpy array

2. Capturing to an OpenCV object

3. Unencoded image capture in YUV format

4. Unencoded image capture in RGB format

5. Custom outputs

6. Unconventional file outputs

7. Rapid capture and processing

8. Unencoded video capture

9. Rapid capture and streaming

10. Web streaming

11. Capturing images whilst recording

12. Recording at multiple resolutions

13. Recording motion vector data

14. Splitting to/from a circular stream

15. Custom encoders

16. Raw Bayer data captures

17. Using a flash with the camera
